# Installing Songs (Meta Quest Version)
---
!> **IMPORTANT:** This guide is for the VR game *Trombone Champ: Unflattened* on **Meta Quest**. For installing custom songs in the **Steam** version, check [this guide](installing-songs-steamvr).<br><br>For installing custom songs in the standard game, see the [mod installation guide for Trombone Champ](installing-r2modman).

Trombone Champ: Unflattened has built-in custom song support, and is compatible with charts made for the standard game. Do note that only video and image backgrounds will work, custom backgrounds made in Unity will not.

?> You can find community made custom charts on [TootTally](https://toottally.com/), or by browsing [TromboneDB](https://tc-mods.github.io/TromboneDB/).

## Adding charts via USB

1. Extract the ZIP files containing the charts you want to copy over. Make sure each the files of each chart (the `song.ogg`, `song.tmb`, and `bg.png`/`bg.mp4`) are stored together in their own folder.

2. Connect your headset to your PC using a USB cable. You should see your headset appear as removable storage.

?> macOS users will need to use a third-party application (such as [OpenMTP](https://openmtp.ganeshrvel.com)) in order to access the storage of their Quest.

3. Open up the Quest's internal storage, and then navigate to `/Android/data/com.ImpactReality.TromboneChamp/files/customtracks/`. Drag and drop the chart folders you created earlier into `customtracks`.

4. Once you've finished copying over the songs you want, start up the game, head into **Free Play**, and then you'll find your custom songs listed in their own category.
