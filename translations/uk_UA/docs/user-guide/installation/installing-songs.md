# Installing Songs
---
?> If you prefer video tutorials, Rayanne has [a video explaining how to install custom songs](https://youtu.be/6ZVxxQPWZlM).

!> **IMPORTANT:** Make sure you've followed the [mod installation guide](installing-r2modman) to install BepInEx and TrombLoader before continuing!

## Finding Songs

Custom songs can be found in the `#custom-charts` channel in the [Trombone Champ Modding Discord](https://discord.gg/KVzKRsbetJ).

If you'd like a more compact list, TheGlitched64 has created [a spreadsheet containing information on every custom chart](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1xpoUnHdSJFqOQEK_637-HCECYtJsgK91oY4dRuDMtik/edit?usp=sharing).

## Installation

1. Download the custom song - it will generally be some kind of archive file, usually ending in `.zip`.

2. Extract the contents of the archive file directly into the `BepInEx/CustomSongs` folder in the r2modman profile directory.

3. Double check that the song is just in one folder instead of nested in multiple - in this example, all the song's files should be located in `BepinEx/CustomSongs/BakaMitai/`.
