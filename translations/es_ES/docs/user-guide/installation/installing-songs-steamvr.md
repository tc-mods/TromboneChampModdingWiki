# Installing Songs (Steam Version)

---

!> **IMPORTANT:** This guide is for the VR game _Trombone Champ: Unflattened_ on **Steam**. For installing custom songs in the standard game, see the [mod installation guide for Trombone Champ](installing-r2modman).

Trombone Champ: Unflattened has built-in custom song support, and is compatible with charts made for the base game. Do note that only video and image backgrounds will work, custom backgrounds made in Unity will not.

?> You can find community made custom charts on [TootTally](https://toottally.com/), or by browsing [TromboneDB](https://tc-mods.github.io/TromboneDB/).

1. Open Steam and select **Trombone Champ: Unflattened**. Click the ⚙️ **Cog Wheel** icon and go to **Manage > Browse local files**.

2. From here, navigate to `TromboneChampUnflattened_Data\StreamingAssets\customtracks\`. In another window or tab, open up the ZIP file containing the chart you downloaded, and then drag the containing folder into the `customtracks` folder.

!> Each chart must be stored in its own folder. If the ZIP file you've downloaded doesn't contain a folder, you will have to make one yourself and then copy the ZIP contents (`song.tmb`, `song.ogg`, and `.bg.png`/`.bg.mp4`) to it.

3. Once you've finished copying over the songs you want, start up the game, head into **Free Play**, and then you'll find your custom songs listed in their own category.
