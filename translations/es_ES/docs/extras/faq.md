## Why is there a black screen with a music note?

Update [TrombLoader](https://github.com/NyxTheShield/TrombLoader/releases/latest). Replace the old dll in `BepInEx/plugins` with the new dll.

## Do custom songs work with a pirated version of the game?

The latest TrombLoader will work on the latest version of Trombone Champ. Buy the game.

## Where can I find custom songs?

Go to `#custom-charts` channel in the [Trombone Champ Modding Discord](https://discord.gg/KVzKRsbetJ).

~~TheGlitched64 has also created [a spreadsheet containing information on every custom chart](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1xpoUnHdSJFqOQEK_637-HCECYtJsgK91oY4dRuDMtik/edit?usp=sharing)~~.

[TromboneDB](https://tc-mods.github.io/TromboneDB/) is a replacement for the spreadsheet which contains mirrors for all of the charts to work around Discord's CDN links expiring.

## Why isn't BepInEx creating folders?

Make sure that you downloaded the x64 BepInEx. Also make sure your folder looks like this: ![Finished BepinEx Install](../docs/files/finishedbepinex.png)

## Why aren't my songs appearing in the game?

Make sure you've unzipped the file. It should look like this: ![Correct Extraction Preview](../docs/files/customsongcorrect.png)

## What do I do with .7zip or .rar files?

You can unzip them with [7-zip](https://www.7-zip.org/download.html).
